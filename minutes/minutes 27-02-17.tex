\section{Notes}
\begin{items}
\item
Report deadline 17/03/17 (should be finished week prior to allow presentation practice).

Owen to travel to Durham for 30 minute presentation 17/03/17 or when convenient for him.

\section{To Do Next}
\begin{items}
\item
Leave the motor running once brushes have been sanded to observe if the motor repairs itself.

\item
Finish data collection in roughly 1.5 weeks time.

\item
Look for coincidence in anomaly metrics, scatter plot the anomaly metrics against each other and identify clusters.

\item
Present a description of a plot and an example to Chris later this week to verify we know what metrics are doing.

\item
Look into wind turbine failure modes, possible avenue of comparison.

\item
Organise a date for presentation with Prof. Chadwick, Chris and Owen.
