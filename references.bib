  abstract =   "This paper introduces a technique for rendering animated
               grass in real time. The technique uses front-to-back
               compositing of implicitly defined grass slices in a fragment
               shader and therefore significantly reduces the overhead
               associated with common vegetation rendering systems. We also
               introduce a texture-based animation scheme that combines
               global wind movements with local turbulences. Since the
               technique is confined to a fragment shader, it can be easily
               integrated into any rendering system and used as a material
               in existing scenes. ",

title={Rank based anomaly detection algorithms},
journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
pages={181},
note={Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works; Last updated - 2016-03-12},
abstract={Anomaly or outlier detection problems are of considerable importance, arising frequently in diverse real-world applications such as finance and cyber-security. Several algorithms have been formulated for such problems, usually based on formulating a problem-dependent heuristic or distance metric. This dissertation proposes anomaly detection algorithms that exploit the notion of "rank," expressing relative outlierness of different points in the relevant space, and exploiting asymmetry in nearest neighbor relations between points: a data point is "more anomalous" if it is not the nearest neighbor of its nearest neighbors. Although rank is computed using distance, it is a more robust and higher level abstraction that is particularly helpful in problems characterized by significant variations of data point density, when distance alone is inadequate. We begin by proposing a rank-based outlier detection algorithm, and then discuss how this may be extended by also considering clustering-based approaches. We show that the use of rank significantly improves anomaly detection performance in a broad range of problems. We then consider the problem of identifying the most anomalous among a set of time series, e.g., the stock price of a company that exhibits significantly different behavior than its peer group of other companies. In such problems, different characteristics of time series are captured by different metrics, and we show that the best performance is obtained by combining several such metrics, along with the use of rank-based algorithms for anomaly detection. In practical scenarios, it is of interest to identify when a time series begins to diverge from the behavior of its peer group. We address this problem as well, using an online version of the anomaly detection algorithm developed earlier. Finally, we address the task of detecting the occurrence of anomalous sub-sequences within a single time series. This is accomplished by refining the multiple-distance combination approach, which succeeds when other algorithms (based on a single distance measure) fail. The algorithms developed in this dissertation can be applied in a large variety of application areas, and can assist in solving many practical problems.},

We evaluate Bidirectional \{LSTM\} (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the \{TIMIT\} database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that \{BLSTM\} is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.11An abbreviated version of some portions of this article appeared in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), as part of the \{IJCNN\} 2005 conference proceedings, published under the \{IEEE\} copyright.
