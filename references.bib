  abstract =   "This paper introduces a technique for rendering animated
               grass in real time. The technique uses front-to-back
               compositing of implicitly defined grass slices in a fragment
               shader and therefore significantly reduces the overhead
               associated with common vegetation rendering systems. We also
               introduce a texture-based animation scheme that combines
               global wind movements with local turbulences. Since the
               technique is confined to a fragment shader, it can be easily
               integrated into any rendering system and used as a material
               in existing scenes. ",
